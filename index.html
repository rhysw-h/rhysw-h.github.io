            One of the main talking points was the lack of ethnic minorities working in schools across the UK. This chart shows that although the number of white teachers and non-white teachers has been converging over the past years, the gap is still too big to consider that any progress has been made.

            As well as this, a panel member suggested that the number of exclusions from schools are not proportional throughout each ethnicity and that black students were much more likely to be excluded than white students. While it is true that Black Carribbean students are double more likely to be excluded than the average exclusion rate, exclusions are much more prevalent among Irish travellers and the Roma.

        <p>
            There are many bad examples of visualisations online and this task was to improve upon one of them. I took a visualisation from a US political election page and have recreated their chart. The chart is a poor example due to the lack of x axis and disproportional bars making it seem like the winning margin was much more than reality.
