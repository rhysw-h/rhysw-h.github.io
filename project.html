        <h2>Conclusion for Tourism</h2>
        <p>
            We observed a positive trend in tourism arrivals in the years following the World Cup, suggesting that more tourists may have visited the host country during the event and continued to do so afterwards. Every host country in our analysis, with the exception of Russia, experienced an increase in tourist arrivals. Russia's deviation from this trend is likely attributable to its conflict with Ukraine during that period, which may have deterred visitors. Additionally, we noted an increase in tourism expenditure in three out of the five host countries examined. However, the increase was not substantial enough to attribute solely to the impact of hosting the World Cup.

        <h2>World Cup Sponsors</h2>
        <p> 
            The 2022 World Cup in Qatar had 4 main sponsors:
            -Adidas,
            -Hyundai,
            -Coca-cola,
            -Visa.

            I created a chart of their stock prices before, during and after the world cup to see whether their values went up due to the sponsorship. I rebased each one on 100 to make comparison easier.
