        <h3>This project examines the relationship between football and economics, focusing on the FIFA World Cup. It aims to explore the potential benefits of hosting the tournament by analysing data on tourism arrivals, tourism expenditure, and GDP growth in host nations. The project also looks at the economic impact of sponsorship on corporate stock prices and investigates whether there is any correlation between a country’s GDP per capita and its performance in the tournament. Using a range of data visualisations, including maps and charts, this work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the World Cup’s economic significance and global influence.</h3>

                <h2>Conclusion 1</h2>
                <p>I observed a positive trend in tourism arrivals in the years following the World Cup, suggesting that more tourists may have visited the host country during the event and continued to do so afterwards. Every host country in our analysis, with the exception of Russia, experienced an increase in tourist arrivals. Russia's deviation from this trend is likely attributable to its conflict with Ukraine during that period, which may have deterred visitors. Additionally, we noted an increase in tourism expenditure in three out of the five host countries examined. However, the increase was not substantial enough to attribute solely to the impact of hosting the World Cup. There did seem to be a trend where World Cup hosts ended up with a higher GDP growth than the winners but it is unclear whether hosting the tournament over winning it caused this.</p>

                <h2>World Cup Sponsors</h2>
                <p>The 2022 World Cup in Qatar had 4 main sponsors: Adidas, Hyundai, Coca-cola, and Visa. I created a chart of their stock prices before, during and after the world cup to see whether their values went up due to the sponsorship. I rebased each one on 100 to make comparison easier.</p>

                <h2>GDP per Capita vs World Cup Performance</h2>
                <p>Next I created a bubble chart of GDP per capita of World Cup participants and compared it to their points per game of all the tournaments they took part in. A bigger bubble means that the team has participated in more competitions. This was created by datascraping a table of all the teams' performances from Wikipedia and dividing points by games played. I then merged this dataset with a GDP per Capita dataset I found on IMF.</p>
                <p>There doesn't seem to be much correlation between GDP per Capita and performance in World Cups but we can see that teams that have participated in more competitions have also achieved the most points per game for the most part.</p>

                <h2>Russia World Cup Stadiums and Regional GDP</h2>
                <p>I then created a vegalite map containing the federal subjects of Russia with their respective regional GDPs. The GRDP data was datascraped from Wikipedia with this Python code. I then layered the stadium locations from the 2018 World Cup and noticed how almost every one chosen was in a region with high GDP, and how all of them were located in Western Russia, probably for convenience for supporters.</p>

            <h2>Data Cleaning Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges I encountered was creating the points-per-game versus GDP per capita chart. I began by scraping points data from a Wikipedia table and calculating points per game for each country by dividing total points by games played. I also had to standardise the country names in the GDP per capita dataset to match those in the World Cup participants dataset, allowing me to merge the two.

                    <p>As well as this, I initially attempted to scrape data from the Yahoo Finance website, but this was unsuccessful. Instead, I used the Yfinance API to collect stock prices from 2022 to 2024. I then wrote a Python script to combine these prices into a single CSV file and rebased all values to 100 at the start for easier comparison.

                    <p>Finally, the Russian regional GDP map presented a significant challenge due to inconsistencies between the federal subject names in the geojson file and the names in the regional GDP table I scraped from Wikipedia. Some names were spelled differently, and others were entirely mismatched. I resolved this by writing a Python script to rename regions in one dataset and iteratively check for consistency until all names matched.

            <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project has highlighted various aspects of the economic impact of the FIFA World Cup, from tourism and GDP growth to corporate sponsorship. While there was clear evidence of increased tourism to host countries, the correlation between hosting the tournament and long-term economic benefits remains inconclusive. The analysis of stock prices of World Cup sponsors also showed some signs of increasing from sponsorship, albeit some fluctuations, but the effects were not significant enough to draw definitive conclusions. The GDP per capita versus World Cup performance chart revealed little correlation between a nation’s economic status and its football success, although countries with more tournament experience tended to perform better. Finally, the exploration of Russian regional GDP and stadium locations provided insights into the concentration of wealth and infrastructure, specifically football stadiums in certain regions, however it is likely this is due to easier access for travelling fans. Overall, while the World Cup does seem to offer some short-term economic benefits, its long-term impact is complex and influenced by various external factors.
